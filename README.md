# RoR Chat on  Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS)

This will deploy a Ruby on Rails 6 chat app with Redis and Postgres backend on ECS using CDK.

## <a name="amazon-ecs"></a>Amazon ECS
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a **fully managed container orchestration** service. ECS has been a foundational pillar for key Amazon services, it can **natively integrate** with other services such as Amazon Route 53, Secrets Manager, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Amazon CloudWatch providing you a familiar experience to deploy and scale your containers. ECS allows your applications the flexibility to use a mix of **Amazon EC2** and **AWS Fargate** with Spot and On-Demand pricing options.

Container Instance:: An AMI instance that is primed for running containers. By default, each Amazon instance uses Amazon ECS-Optimized Linux AMI. This is the recommended image to run ECS container service. The key components of this base image are:
. Amazon Linux AMI
. Amazon ECS Container Agent â€“ manages containers lifecycle on behalf of ECS and allows them to connect to the cluster
. Docker Engine

Task:: A task is defined as a JSON file and describes an application that contains one or more container definitions. This usually points to Docker images from a registry, port/volume mapping, etc.

Service:: ECS maintains the "`desired state`" of your application. This is achieved by creating a service. A service specifies the number of instances of a task definition that needs to run at a given time. If the task in a service becomes unhealthy or stop running, then the service scheduler will bounce the task. It ensures that the desired and actual state are match. This is what provides resilience in ECS.New tasks within a Service are balanced across Availability Zones in your cluster. Service scheduler figures out which container instances can meet the needs of a service and schedules it on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (one with the fewest number of tasks running).

### <a name="setup-cloud9"></a>Setup Cloud9
1. Click the link [here](https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/product?region=ap-southeast-1) to go to Cloud9 console. Sign in with your credentials if necessary. You need to be in **Singapore** region for this lab.

2. Click on **Create Environment**.

3. Give any appropriate name and description to your environment. Click on **Next**.

4. Choose an instance type and click on **Next**.

5. Click on **Create Environment**.

6. After a few minutes, when your environment is up, you will be redirected to the Cloud9 IDE.

### <a name="resize-ebs-storage"></a>Resize EBS storage

Create a script file named resize.sh and use the code provided [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/move-environment.html#move-environment-resize) based on the distro used.

Execute the script to resize EBS to 100GB
```
$ sh resize.sh 100
```
Reboot instance from the EC2 console

### <a name="install-docker-composer"></a>Install Docker composer
 [Install Docker Compose | Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
```
$ sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.5/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Clone repo https://github.com/enghwa/RoRChat-cdk.git
```
$ cd RoRChat-cdk/
$ git clone https://github.com/enghwa/RoRChat RoRChat
$ cd RoRChat
```

Build the docker container locally for the RoR6 chat app
```
$ docker build -t ror6dev --build-arg USER_ID=$(id -u) --build-arg GROUP_ID=$(id -g) .
```

Setup the database
```
$ docker-compose run  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -p8080:8010  ror6 bundle exec rake db:setup 
```

Bring up the app with mySQL and Redis locally
```
$ docker-compose run  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -p8080:8010  ror6
```

Preview the application in CLoud9 and it will show an error to add an entry into config.

Add the following line to the end of the file /config/environments/development.rb
```
#example, dont copy
  config.hosts << "cb2c7446f879462c897b3a79679d8e59.vfs.cloud9.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com"
```

Bring up the app with mySQL and Redis locally again
```
$ docker-compose run  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -p8080:8010  ror6
```

Access application in a seperate browser tab
